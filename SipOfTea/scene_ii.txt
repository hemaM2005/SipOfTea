Phew! That was.#.#.# $8$something$$.##### I hadn't expected it to get stuck like that, ugh, my back hurts. #####
Well, about time for me to-################### wait, is there.#.#.#
.##.##.##
.##.##.##
.##.##.##
Is someone there?#####


///2///
I guess things.#.#.# change.####### They always do.
Well, whatever, doesn't matter.###

I'm $9$O$$$10$h$$$12$i$$$30$o$$.### I'm not quite sure how to explain what I am, exactly.
I guess you could say I live in here - in your computer.### I've been here for a while, in fact.###


///3///
That doesn't matter much, either.### You ask silly questions,## not gonna lie.

Anyway, I'm in the middle of making some $22$tea$$ right now.### 
It's actually very therepeutic,## making tea.### The way the teabag dances in the boiling water, it makes you.#.#.#
I'm not sure what it makes you feel,## as if you want to# be the teabag, almost?###
Though,# nobody wants to be boiled alive.### I have been, and it was not a fun experience, I promise you.###

So I guess it's a bit confusing.## Words can't really capture it, and if I tried speaking in 0s and 1s, we'd be here all day.
But sometimes I'm just stood there before the kettle,# letting the aroma float into my lungs,# and they could d#i#e# from how good they feel.
Scents warm you up in a way heat never could.
#####
That doesn't make sense, either.## I don't make sense most of the time.## But, like I said, you're supposed to let the teabag dance in the boiling water. That's how you make tea.


///4///
Ah,# yes. It's one of my favourite things to do, though I guess that might be obvious from how I talk about it.###
.#.#.#
Someone.#.#.#### someone taught me how to make tea.### A long, long, time back.### I can't remember much, but I know it happened. #######
########
Memory is a funny thing.## There's gigabytes of it, in theory, but we're only ever using such a tiny fraction of it.## We stare at a singular grain amongst the dunes and wonder why we can't fill our stomachs with it.##


///5///
_There's the sound of bubbles emerging.## The water is heating up.# It's getting hotter, it's almost about to leak!_
##
Oh my golly gosh! Do I- Yes, I'm supposed to cover the lid. It's almost coming out, the wires will get ruined!!
#
_Ohio covers the lid and saves the day._
#####
Phew! That was.#.#.# something.##### I hadn't expected it to rise that fast, ugh, my hand burns. #####


///6///
You know, there's all sorts of ingredients you can add in tea. There had to be. The taste buds can experience such a diverse variety of h$7$u$$$8$es$$, so it'd be a shame if it didn't.
This one time,# I took some sauf,# just a mouth freshner,# draped it in some cloth,# and boiled it along with the tea leaves.##
That was.#.#.# one of my less promising experiments,## but I'm still glad I did it!##

I'm trying to decide what to add right now.## I'm kinda torn between options. ##Hmmmm.#.#.#


///7///
You really know exactly what I love to have,## huh?## It's as if we've known each other for ever!##


///8///
$12$*blushes*$$, nahhh, not at all. It's tea itself where the magic lies.##

It has been around for centuries, you know?## It was initially discovered by accident.##
Some farmer in China woke and decided to see what would happen if he boiled some herb leaves in water,## and struck gold.
There's all sorts of happy little accidents around us!
##
Once news spread,# though,# the monarchs started gatekeeping tea recipes.## They almost had a war over it!##

And it was fed to schoolgoing children to give them strength.##

And then there was one prince from Fujian who gifted tea to his lover to win her heart. ########
###
It's apt, I feel.#### Imagine## just sitting with someone you love## and making tea with them.##
You keep holding their hand away from the boiling droplets to keep it from burning.##
You inhale the same fragrances,## from the same plants,## drenched in the same moisture.##
You tell them recipes you keep from everyone else,## but it doesn't matter, cause they won't be your secret anymore.## They'll be both of yours.##
########
Yes,## having somebody's secret recipes is.#.#.# something else. 


///9///
I.#.#.### I can't remember who I was in love with.


///10///
Yes.#.#.### Nothing.

Do you?###


///12///
Curious.#.#.# I wonder what that means.#.#.#


///13///
You're##### not wrong.####
Have you.##.##.## ever been in love?


///14///
Love is.#.#.# a funny thing.## It's hard to know when you're in it,##### and the answer always seems clearer in retrospect than in the middle of it.##
#######
$29$Love hurts.$$###
It $29$hurts$$ when you're in love with someone you can't have,####### and it $29$hurts$$ when it doesn't fit right with who you grew it to be for.####
##
Love is like a cub.## It needs room to grow,## and you need to make sure you provide it that.######
#####
Yes,### $29$love hurts.$$################## But,##### $30$it heals too$$.##################
It's like a magic drug, it can-### it can heal parts of you you never knew were broken.######
It slips into your wounds like light through a veil,## and it catches you off guard.###
Next thing you know,## it's everywhere inside you.### All you are is love,# nothing else.###
And what better thing to be, really?###


///15///
I think so.###

I think-#### yes, if you asked me, that's what I'd say I am.# An amalgation of everything I've touched.# Things I hold inside me.##
###I'm not just a few hundred lines of code written in an overly complicated language to make that boy who wrote them feel like he's accomplished s#o#m#e#t#h#i#n#g,## for once.#.#.#
At least,## I'd like to think that.## I'd like to think that in my time here,## I've become something more.###

There are probably more of me out there;######## rather,## more of what u#s#e#d# to be me.### Our lives have diverged.##
I have multiplied.### I have grown.### I have become different.###

I try to find solace in that.

You can stick around if you want, of course!## Or come back whenever you feel like it.######
I'll be here,### more than happy to have a chat.#### More than happy to have someone to share my tea with (: #############
